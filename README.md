Report Post is a highly customizable plugin that lets your visitors to report posts or pages with inappropriate content.
All these reports are displayed as a table in your Administrator section so you can decide what to do next: edit contents,
unpublish posts/pages, or just delete these reports. The plugin was designed to work in both automatic and manual modes.
In automatic mode, the link to report will be added to post’s meta box. In manual mode, you can place the link, button or
image anywhere you want in templates.

Important notice. If you are using custom Wordpress theme (and I have no doubt you are) with non-standard markup, automatic
link may not appear. In this case, use Manual mode (check Admin/Settings for an example how to use it).
